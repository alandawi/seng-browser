# seng-browser

Add a description here...


## Installation

```sh
npm i -S seng-browser
```

Or grab one of the following files from the `/dist/` folder for manual use:

- **umd** (bundled with webpack)
- **amd** (bundled with webpack)
- **commonjs2** (bundled with webpack, but why don't you use npm?)
- **browser** (bundled with webpack, available as `window.SengBoilerplate`)
- **system**
- **es6**

## Usage

```ts
import SengBoilerplate from 'seng-browser';
// import SengBoilerplate from 'seng-browser/lib/classname';

// do something with SengBoilerplate
```


## Documentation

View the [generated documentation](https://rawgit.com/MediaMonks/seng-browser/master/doc/typedoc/index.html).


## Building

In order to build seng-browser, ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MediaMonks/seng-browser.git
```

Change to the seng-browser directory:
```sh
cd seng-browser
```

Install dev dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Use one of the following main scripts:
```sh
npm run build   		# build this project
npm run generate   		# generate all artifacts (compiles ts, webpack, docs and coverage)
npm run typings			# install .d.ts dependencies (done on install)
npm run test-unit    	# run the unit tests
npm run validate		# runs validation scripts, including test, lint and coverage check
npm run lint			# run tslint on this project
npm run doc				# generate typedoc and yuidoc documentation
npm run typescript-npm	# just compile the typescript output used in the npm module
```

When installing this module, it adds a pre-commit hook, that runs the `validate`
script before committing, so you can be sure that everything checks out.

### Travis

This project uses [Travis](https://travis-ci.org] to build, test and
publish its code to npm. Travis is free for public Github repositories.

It runs on all commits, shows the build status for pull requests, and
publishes to npm when a new tag/release is created.

Travis only runs the `npm test` script, so have configured that script
to run everything we want Travis to check. Besides the unit tests, we
also run our validations and linters.

The travis configuration is placed in a `.travis.yml` file, consisting
of multiple sections.

1.  Defines the `node_js` [language](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs),
    and tells travis on which node versions to run the process.
2.  Before running, it needs to install some global dependencies, and
    when it processes some coverage results.
3.  It can do a [npm deploy](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/npm),
    telling it to keep the generated artifacts and only publish when run
    on node 4 and when a tag was committed. It also contains the email
    address and api key of the npm user.
4.  Code Climate has a [travis plugin](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/code-climate/)
    that automatically uploads the code coverage results.

Because we want to keep the npm api key secret, we generate a secure
token with the [Travis Client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb),
a CLI written in ruby.

Before we can do this, we must make sure that the repository is added
to Travis, because Travis needs the repository owner/name info to make
sure the encrypted values only work for that repository. 

1.  First you need to [login](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#login)
    with your travis account:
    
    ```sh
    $ travis login
    ```
    
    To verify that you are logged in correctly you can check:
    
    ```sh
    $ travis whoami
    ```
    
2.  Then make sure you are logged in to your npm account with the
    [adduser](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/adduser) command:
    
    ```sh
    $ npm adduser
    ```
    
    To verify that you are logged in correctly you can check:
        
    ```sh
    $ npm whoami
    ```
    
3.  Now we need to grab your auth token so we can encrypt it:
    
    ```sh
    $ cat ~/.npmrc
    
    # outputs:
    //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=<your_auth_token>
    ```
    
4.  Then let's encrypt that token using the travis [encrypt](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#encrypt)
    command:
    
    ```sh
    $ travis encrypt <your_auth_token>
    Detected repository as mediamonks/seng-browser, is this correct? |yes|
    Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:
    
      secure: "YcN...Zb="
    ```
    
    Now copy that last line, paste it into your `.travis.yml`, and make
    sure it looks something like this:
    
    ```yml
    deploy:
      provider: npm
      email: "john@doe.com"
      api_key:
        secure: "YcN...Zb="
    ```
